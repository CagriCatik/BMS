<p>A <strong>Battery Management System (BMS)</strong> is an electronic control unit used in electric and hybrid vehicles to optimize the performance, safety, and lifespan of the battery. It continuously monitors the state of the battery, controls charging and discharging processes, protects against potential hazards, and communicates with other systems within the vehicle.</p>
<h4 id="111-objectives-of-a-bms"><a class="header" href="#111-objectives-of-a-bms">1.1.1 Objectives of a BMS</a></h4>
<p>The primary objectives of a BMS include ensuring safety by preventing dangerous conditions such as overcharging, deep discharging, overheating, or short circuits. Additionally, it aims to optimize performance by maximizing the available energy and power of the battery, extending the battery's lifespan by minimizing aging effects through optimal operating conditions, and integrating seamlessly into the vehicle by communicating with other control units and systems for overall optimization.</p>
<h3 id="12-main-functions-of-a-bms"><a class="header" href="#12-main-functions-of-a-bms">1.2 Main Functions of a BMS</a></h3>
<h4 id="121-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#121-monitoring">1.2.1 Monitoring</a></h4>
<p>Monitoring is one of the core functions of a BMS and involves the continuous collection and analysis of various parameters. This includes voltage measurement, where the voltage of each individual cell or cell group is monitored to ensure it remains within safe operating limits, thus preventing overvoltage or undervoltage that could lead to cell damage or failure. Current measurement involves capturing the charging and discharging currents to avoid overloading, as high currents can cause overheating or mechanical stresses within the battery. Temperature measurement oversees the temperatures of the cells and the entire battery pack, as temperatures outside the optimal range can impair performance and increase the risk of thermal runaway. The State of Charge (SoC) determines the current charge level of the battery, expressed as a percentage of total capacity, which is important for range indication and energy management. The State of Health (SoH) assesses the battery's overall condition to recognize aging effects and estimate the remaining lifespan. For example, in the <strong>Tesla Model S</strong>, thousands of cells are monitored to provide an accurate SoC indication and to utilize the battery optimally.</p>
<h4 id="122-cell-balancing"><a class="header" href="#122-cell-balancing">1.2.2 Cell Balancing</a></h4>
<p>Cell balancing ensures that all cells within the battery pack are uniformly charged to guarantee maximum performance and longevity. Passive balancing involves dissipating excess energy from fuller cells as heat to align their charge levels with those of less charged cells, typically achieved through resistors. Active balancing, on the other hand, transfers energy from cells with higher voltage to those with lower voltage, which is more efficient since energy is not lost. For instance, the <strong>Porsche Taycan</strong> employs active balancing to meet high-performance requirements and maximize the battery's lifespan.</p>
<h4 id="123-protection"><a class="header" href="#123-protection">1.2.3 Protection</a></h4>
<p>The BMS implements various protection mechanisms to safeguard the battery from hazardous conditions. Overcharge protection prevents cells from being charged beyond their maximum voltage, which could lead to thermal runaway. Deep discharge protection ensures that cell voltages do not fall below the minimum allowable voltage, which can cause irreversible damage. Short circuit protection detects and interrupts current flows caused by short circuits. Additionally, temperature protection reduces charging and discharging currents or shuts down the battery if temperatures fall outside the safe range. For example, the <strong>Chevrolet Bolt</strong> features a BMS that reduces the charging speed at high temperatures to protect the battery.</p>
