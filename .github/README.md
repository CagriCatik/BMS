## Documentation

This repository includes detailed documentation built with **mdBook**, providing insights into using and extending the available tools and models.

1. **Install mdBook**  
   Install `mdBook` by following the [official installation guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).  
   Example with `cargo`:
   ```bash
   cargo install mdbook
   ```

2. **Build the Documentation**  
   Navigate to the `docs` folder and build the documentation:
   ```bash
   mdbook build
   ```
   The generated files will be available in the `docs/book` directory.

3. **Serve the Documentation Locally**  
   Preview the documentation by running:
   ```bash
   mdbook serve
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Deploy the Documentation**  
   Upload the contents of the `docs/book` folder to any static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
