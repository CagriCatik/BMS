# Calendar Aging in Batteries

## Introduction

Calendar aging refers to the deterioration of a battery's capacity, efficiency, and overall performance over time, even when the battery is not actively in use. This phenomenon significantly impacts lithium-ion batteries, widely used in electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and energy storage systems. Understanding the mechanisms, influencing factors, and mitigation strategies for calendar aging is essential for improving battery life and performance, making it a critical consideration in the design and management of Battery Management Systems (BMS).

This document provides an in-depth exploration of calendar aging, including its mechanisms, factors affecting it, technical impacts, and strategies to minimize its effects.

## 1. Understanding Calendar Aging

### 1.1 Definition
Calendar aging occurs due to chemical and physical changes within the battery over time, irrespective of the battery's operational state. These changes are primarily driven by:
- Electrolyte decomposition
- Growth of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI)
- Loss of active lithium ions
- Degradation of the electrode materials

### 1.2 Key Indicators
- **Capacity Loss:** Reduction in the total amount of charge the battery can store.
- **Increased Internal Resistance:** Impedes current flow, reducing power delivery efficiency.
- **Voltage Changes:** Alters the battery's ability to maintain stable voltage levels during discharge.

## 2. Mechanisms of Calendar Aging

### 2.1 Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) Growth
- The SEI layer forms on the anode during initial battery cycling.
- Over time, the SEI layer continues to grow, consuming active lithium ions and increasing internal resistance.

### 2.2 Electrolyte Decomposition
- At elevated temperatures, the electrolyte undergoes decomposition, releasing gases and creating undesirable byproducts.
- This reduces the availability of active materials, leading to capacity fade.

### 2.3 Cathode and Anode Degradation
- High temperatures accelerate the dissolution of transition metals from the cathode.
- The anode may experience lithium plating, especially during storage at high states of charge (SOC).

## 3. Factors Influencing Calendar Aging

### 3.1 Storage Temperature
Temperature is the most critical factor affecting calendar aging:
- **High Temperatures (Above 40°C):**
  - Accelerate chemical reactions.
  - Increase SEI layer growth and electrolyte decomposition.
  - Lead to faster capacity loss and resistance rise.
- **Low Temperatures (Below 15°C):**
  - Slow down aging but may result in lithium plating during reactivation.

| **Temperature (°C)** | **Effect on Calendar Aging**               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0–15                  | Slow degradation, ideal for storage.     |
| 15–25                 | Minimal degradation, best performance.   |
| 25–40                 | Moderate degradation, manageable impact. |
| >40                   | Rapid degradation, significant capacity loss.|

### 3.2 State of Charge (SOC)
The battery's SOC during storage affects its degradation rate:
- **High SOC (>80%):**
  - Promotes electrolyte oxidation and SEI growth.
  - Causes stress on the cathode structure.
- **Low SOC (<20%):**
  - May result in copper dissolution from the anode.
- **Optimal SOC (40-60%):**
  - Minimizes internal stress and reduces aging effects.

| **SOC Range (%)** | **Impact on Calendar Aging**              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| <20                | Risk of anode copper dissolution.       |
| 20–40              | Low degradation, safe for storage.      |
| 40–60              | Optimal range, minimal calendar aging.  |
| >80                | Accelerates SEI growth and aging.       |

### 3.3 Storage Environment
Environmental factors also play a role:
- **Humidity:** Can penetrate the battery casing, leading to internal corrosion.
- **Ventilation:** Poor ventilation can trap heat, exacerbating temperature-related aging.

## 4. Calendar Aging Effects on Battery Performance

### 4.1 Capacity Fade
- Reduction in the battery's maximum charge storage capacity over time.
- Commonly expressed as a percentage of the initial capacity.

### 4.2 Increased Internal Resistance
- Resistance within the battery increases due to SEI growth and material degradation.
- Higher resistance reduces power delivery and charge acceptance efficiency.

### 4.3 Thermal Stability
- Aging impacts the thermal stability of the battery, increasing the risk of thermal runaway under stress.

| **Performance Metric** | **Impact of Calendar Aging** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Capacity                | Declines progressively.    |
| Internal Resistance     | Rises over time.           |
| Energy Efficiency       | Decreases significantly.   |
| Thermal Stability       | Reduced over long periods. |
