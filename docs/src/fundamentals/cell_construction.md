# Cell Construction

---

Battery cells are the fundamental units of energy storage in a battery pack. The design, structure, and arrangement of these cells determine the battery's performance, efficiency, and safety. This section explores the internal construction of cylindrical and prismatic cells, highlighting their components, design principles, and operational features.

### Key Components of a Battery Cell

A battery cell consists of three primary components:

1. **Cathode (Positive Terminal)**  
   The cathode is the positively charged electrode that facilitates the movement of electrons during discharge.

2. **Anode (Negative Terminal)**  
   The anode is the negatively charged electrode that provides electrons during discharge.

3. **Separator**  
   A separator is a thin, insulating layer that prevents direct contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ionic flow.

### Cylindrical Cells

#### Structural Design
Cylindrical cells are constructed in a rolled or "jelly-roll" configuration:
- Layers of the cathode, separator, and anode are stacked and rolled into a cylindrical shape, similar to how steel sheets are rolled for transportation.
- The rolled structure is encased in a metal shell, which serves as the cell's negative terminal.

#### Advantages
- The outer casing is robust and conductive, simplifying the design for connecting to the circuit.
- The top of the cell is typically plastic-insulated, ensuring safety during handling.

#### Electrical Potential
- When measured with a voltmeter:
  - The positive terminal of the voltmeter is placed on the top terminal.
  - The negative terminal can be placed on the outer metal casing to measure the cell's voltage.
- If the insulation on the outer surface is compromised, the metal casing can exhibit the cell's full potential.

### Prismatic Cells

#### Structural Design
Prismatic cells resemble a notebook:
- The "covers" are made of hard materials, such as cardboard-like casings, to provide structural integrity.
- The "pages" inside consist of stacked layers of the cathode, separator, and anode, arranged in a flat, rectangular format.

#### Features
- **Open Pressure Band**  
   - A safety mechanism to release internal gases formed due to chemical reactions.  
   - Opens under high pressure to prevent cell rupture.
- Prismatic cells are more compact and suited for applications requiring efficient space utilization.

#### Terminals
- Prismatic cells use screws to secure terminals, enabling easy connections to external circuits.
- **Tabs (Current Collectors)**:
  - Made of aluminum and copper, serving as positive and negative terminals respectively.

|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Shape**            | Cylindrical, rolled structure   | Rectangular, stacked structure  |
| **Casing Material**  | Metal shell (negative terminal) | Hard case (e.g., plastic/cardboard) |
| **Terminals**        | Insulated plastic top, metal casing | Screw terminals for connections |
| **Safety Features**  | Robust insulation               | Open pressure band              |
| **Applications**     | Durable, versatile              | Space-efficient, compact        |

### Variations: Soft Pack Cells
Soft pack cells are similar to prismatic cells but lack a rigid casing:
- Constructed by stacking layers of components without the hard outer case.
- Lightweight and flexible, suitable for applications where weight is a critical factor.

### Material Composition
- **Positive Terminal (Cathode Tab):** Aluminum
- **Negative Terminal (Anode Tab):** Copper

These materials are selected for their conductivity and compatibility with the electrochemical reactions within the cell.
