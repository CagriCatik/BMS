### Comparative Analysis of Battery Chemistries

Batteries are selected based on six key parameters:

1. **Energy Specificity**: The amount of energy stored per unit weight.
2. **Power**: The ability to deliver high currents.
3. **Safety**: Resistance to thermal runaway and chemical stability.
4. **Performance**: Efficiency across temperature ranges and cycling stability.
5. **Life**: Total charge-discharge cycles before degradation.
6. **Cost**: Manufacturing and material expenses.

## Design Trade-offs in Lithium-Ion Batteries

### Balancing Parameters

Battery chemistries are often optimized for specific applications, leading to trade-offs between parameters:

- **LFP Batteries**: Prioritize safety and lifespan over energy density, making them ideal for electric buses and energy storage systems.
- **NMC Batteries**: Balance energy density and cost, commonly used in electric vehicles.
- **NCA Batteries**: Optimize for energy density and performance at the expense of safety, often used in Tesla vehicles.

### Case Study: Safety vs. Performance
- **Tesla’s NCA Chemistry**: Designed for high specific energy, but safety compromises led to incidents of battery fires.
- **LFP Chemistry**: Though costlier, LFP batteries offer unmatched safety and lifespan, capable of sustaining 15,000–20,000 cycles compared to NMC’s 3,000 cycles.
