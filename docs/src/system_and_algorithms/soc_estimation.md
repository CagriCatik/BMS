# Initial SoC Estimation

## **Introduction**
Battery Management Systems (BMS) play a crucial role in the operation and management of batteries in modern applications, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems, and portable electronics. This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of critical BMS concepts, focusing on **State of Charge (SoC) Estimation**, **Coulomb Counting**, and foundational algorithms. It is structured to provide both foundational knowledge and technical depth for engineers and professionals in the field.

## **State of Charge (SoC) Estimation**

### **1. Overview**
State of Charge (SoC) represents the available capacity of a battery as a percentage of its total capacity. Accurate SoC estimation is critical for ensuring optimal battery performance, preventing overcharging or deep discharging, and prolonging battery life.

---

### **2. Initial SoC Estimation**
Initial SoC estimation involves determining the battery's SoC after a prolonged period of inactivity or at the start of operation. This process is divided into two main stages:

#### **2.1 Static SoC Estimation**
- **Definition**: Static SoC estimation determines the battery's charge state when it is at rest (no current flow).
- **Key Conditions**:
  - **Zero Current Flow**: The current drawn from or pumped into the battery must be zero.
  - **Time Constraint**: The battery must remain in a static state for a minimum duration (e.g., 10 seconds).
- **Example Scenario**: A vehicle at a red traffic signal or parked can be considered in a static state, provided no significant current flows.

#### **2.2 Procedure for Initial SoC Estimation**
1. **Voltage Measurement**: Measure the terminal voltage of the battery under static conditions.
2. **Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)**:
   - When the current is zero, the terminal voltage equals the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV).
   - The OCV is a key parameter for determining SoC.
3. **OCV-SoC Lookup Table**:
   - Use an OCV-SoC chart specific to the battery chemistry (e.g., lithium-ion).
   - Convert the measured OCV to the corresponding SoC value using a pre-defined lookup table.

| **Voltage (V)** | **SoC (%)** |
|------------------|-------------|
| 4.2              | 100         |
| 3.6              | 50          |
| 3.0              | 0           |

### **3. Coulomb Counting Method**
Coulomb Counting is a dynamic SoC estimation technique used during battery operation.

#### **3.1 Definition**
Coulomb Counting calculates SoC based on the net current flow over time, integrating charge inflows and outflows.

#### **3.2 Equation**
\[
\text{SoC}_{t+1} = \text{SoC}_t - \frac{I \cdot \Delta t}{C}
\]

- **Terms**:
  - \(\text{SoC}_{t+1}\): SoC at the next time step.
  - \(\text{SoC}_t\): SoC at the current time step.
  - \(I\): Current flow (positive for charging, negative for discharging).
  - \(\Delta t\): Time interval between measurements.
  - \(C\): Battery capacity in ampere-hours (Ah).

#### **3.3 Key Considerations**
- **Sampling Rate**: The frequency at which current data is sampled affects the accuracy of SoC estimation.
  - For example, sampling every 100 milliseconds requires multiplying the current by 0.1 seconds.
- **Battery Aging**: Battery capacity decreases over time, requiring periodic recalibration of SoC algorithms.

#### **3.4 Advantages and Limitations**
| **Advantages**                           | **Limitations**                         |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| High accuracy during operation           | Errors accumulate over time             |
| Suitable for real-time applications      | Requires precise current measurement    |
| Complements static SoC estimation        | Sensitive to noise and drift in sensors |

## **State of Health (SoH) Estimation**

### **1. Overview**
State of Health (SoH) quantifies the overall health of the battery, representing its remaining capacity as a percentage of the original capacity.

### **2. Factors Affecting SoH**
- **Capacity Fade**: Reduction in total capacity due to repeated charge/discharge cycles.
- **Internal Resistance**: Increase in resistance leading to reduced efficiency.
- **Temperature Effects**: Degradation caused by operating at extreme temperatures.

## **Implementation in MATLAB**

### **1. Algorithm Design**
The initial and dynamic SoC estimation algorithms can be implemented in MATLAB to simulate and validate the BMS operation.

#### **1.1 Steps for Implementation**
1. Define the battery parameters (capacity, chemistry, aging factors).
2. Create an OCV-SoC lookup table based on battery specifications.
3. Implement the static SoC estimation algorithm:
   - Monitor current and voltage.
   - Apply conditions for static state detection.
4. Implement the Coulomb Counting algorithm:
   - Integrate current over time intervals.
   - Include compensation for sensor noise and drift.
5. Test and validate the algorithms with various current profiles (e.g., square pulse, triangular waveform).

---

### **2. Simulation Scenarios**
- **Continuous Current**: Simulate steady-state operation.
- **Dynamic Current**: Test performance under variable load conditions.
- **Aging Effects**: Evaluate SoC estimation with degraded battery capacity.

#### **Example MATLAB Pseudo-Code**
```matlab
% Define battery parameters
capacity = 100; % in Ah
initial_SoC = 100; % in %

% OCV-SoC Lookup Table
OCV = [4.2, 4.0, 3.8, 3.6, 3.4, 3.2];
SoC = [100, 90, 75, 50, 25, 0];

% Static SoC Estimation
if (current == 0 && time_static > 10)
    measured_voltage = terminal_voltage;
    estimated_SoC = interp1(OCV, SoC, measured_voltage);
end

% Coulomb Counting
delta_t = 0.1; % Sampling interval in seconds
for t = 1:length(current_data)
    SoC(t+1) = SoC(t) - (current_data(t) * delta_t) / capacity;
end
```
