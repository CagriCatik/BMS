## **What is the State of Health (SOH)?**

The **State of Health (SOH)** is a quantitative metric that reflects the current condition of a battery relative to its ideal, manufacturer-specified state. Expressed as a percentage, SOH provides a holistic view of the battery's overall performance and longevity. The mathematical representation of SOH is as follows:

\[
\text{SOH} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Battery Condition}}{\text{Ideal (New) Battery Condition}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

- **100% SOH:** Signifies that the battery retains its original specifications, exhibiting performance metrics equivalent to a new battery.
- **Decreasing SOH:** Indicates degradation due to factors such as aging, repeated charge-discharge cycles, and operational stresses, reflecting diminished capacity and efficiency.

Understanding and accurately assessing SOH is essential for predicting battery lifespan, scheduling maintenance, and ensuring the reliable operation of battery-dependent systems.

## **Factors Influencing SOH**

Battery degradation is an inevitable process influenced by various internal and external factors. The primary factors contributing to the decline in SOH include:

1. **Charge-Discharge Cycles:**
   - **Mechanism:** Each charge-discharge cycle induces wear on the battery's internal structures, such as electrode materials and electrolyte composition.
   - **Impact:** Repeated cycling leads to capacity fade, reducing the maximum charge the battery can hold over time.

2. **Increased Cell Resistance or Impedance:**
   - **Mechanism:** Aging and chemical changes within the battery increase internal resistance, impeding efficient charge transfer.
   - **Impact:** Higher impedance diminishes the battery's ability to deliver or accept charge quickly, reducing overall efficiency.

3. **Capacity Reduction:**
   - **Mechanism:** The maximum charge capacity of the battery diminishes due to material degradation and loss of active sites within the electrodes.
   - **Impact:** A lower maximum capacity directly reduces the energy the battery can store and deliver.

4. **Self-Discharge Rate:**
   - **Mechanism:** Batteries naturally lose charge over time, a rate that accelerates with aging and damage.
   - **Impact:** An increased self-discharge rate can lead to reduced availability of charge when needed, affecting reliability.

5. **Battery Age:**
   - **Mechanism:** Independent of usage, chemical reactions within the battery progress over time, leading to gradual degradation.
   - **Impact:** Even with minimal use, the passage of time results in a decline in battery performance and capacity.

These factors collectively influence the SOH, necessitating comprehensive monitoring and management within the BMS to mitigate their effects.

## **Methods of Evaluating SOH**

Assessing SOH involves a combination of direct and indirect measurement techniques, often integrated within the BMS to provide real-time health monitoring. The methodologies can be broadly categorized into capacity-based, impedance/resistance-based, self-discharge rate analysis, cycle counting, and hybrid approaches.
