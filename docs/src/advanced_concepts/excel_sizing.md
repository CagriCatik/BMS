## 1. **Introduction to Batteries and BMS**

### 1.1 Purpose of Battery Management Systems
A Battery Management System (BMS) ensures the optimal performance, longevity, and safety of a battery pack. It manages:
- **State of Charge (SOC):** Tracking battery charge levels.
- **State of Health (SOH):** Assessing battery degradation.
- **Thermal Management:** Regulating battery temperature.
- **Cell Balancing:** Maintaining uniform charge across cells.

### 1.2 Importance in Applications
BMS is critical for applications in electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage, and portable electronics due to its role in ensuring safety, efficiency, and performance.

## 2. **Battery Design Process**

### 2.1 Cell Data
#### Key Parameters:
- **Height, Length, and Width:** Used to calculate the physical dimensions and volume.
- **Nominal Capacity vs. Usable Capacity:** Incorporates buffer capacities (e.g., 80-20% SOC limits).

#### Example:
| Parameter         | Value       |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Nominal Capacity   | 50 Ah      |
| Usable Capacity    | 40 Ah (80% SOC) |
| Voltage (Nominal)  | 3.6 V      |

### 2.2 Energy Capacity (kWh)
The energy capacity of a battery defines its range and application:
- **Nominal Voltage:** Ideal equilibrium voltage (e.g., 650 V).
- **Maximum Voltage:** Typically at 100% SOC.
- **Minimum Voltage:** Typically at 0% SOC.

#### Calculation:
\[
\text{Energy Capacity (kWh)} = \text{Nominal Voltage} \times \text{Usable Capacity}
\]

#### Example Variants:
| Variant | Energy Capacity (kWh) | Application Range (km) |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| A       | 115                   | 500                    |
| B       | 60                    | 300                    |

## 3. **Battery Pack Configuration**

### 3.1 Series and Parallel Connections
- **Series Configuration:** Increases voltage.
- **Parallel Configuration:** Increases capacity.

#### Example:
- **2S4P Configuration:** 2 cells in series, 4 parallel strings.

| Configuration | Voltage (V) | Capacity (Ah) |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2S4P          | 7.2         | 200            |

### 3.2 Modules
Modules are intermediate units within a battery pack:
- **Voltage Limits per Module:** Defined based on application requirements.
- Example: 
  - 50-cell module: Voltage = \( 50 \times 3.6 \, V = 180 \, V \).
  - 60-cell module: Voltage = \( 60 \times 3.6 \, V = 216 \, V \).

## 4. **Battery Pack Design**

### 4.1 Steps for Pack Design
1. **Determine Required Energy:** Based on application range and usage.
2. **Select Cell Configuration:** Series and parallel combinations to meet voltage and capacity needs.
3. **Calculate Total Voltage:**
   \[
   \text{Total Voltage} = \text{Number of Cells in Series} \times \text{Nominal Voltage per Cell}
   \]
4. **Calculate Total Capacity:**
   \[
   \text{Total Capacity} = \text{Number of Parallel Strings} \times \text{Capacity per Cell}
   \]
5. **Compute Total Energy:**
   \[
   \text{Energy (kWh)} = \text{Total Voltage} \times \text{Total Capacity}
   \]

### 4.2 Example Calculation
For a 115 kWh pack:
- **Nominal Voltage:** 650 V
- **Nominal Cell Voltage:** 3.6 V
- **Usable Capacity per Cell:** 40 Ah

#### Steps:
1. Cells in Series:
   \[
   \text{Cells in Series} = \frac{650}{3.6} \approx 180
   \]
2. Total Energy:
   \[
   \text{Energy (kWh)} = 650 \times 40 = 26 \, \text{kWh per module}
   \]

## 5. **Battery Pack Assembly**

### 5.1 Module and Pack Configuration
- Modules are combined to form a pack.
- Example: A pack with three 26 kWh modules connected in series provides:
  \[
  \text{Total Energy} = 3 \times 26 \, \text{kWh} = 78 \, \text{kWh}.
  \]

### 5.2 Strings
A string is a parallel connection of packs. For higher capacity:
- Connect multiple strings in parallel.
- Example: Two strings, each 78 kWh, provide 156 kWh.

## 6. **Excel for Battery Design**
Excel is widely used in industry for:
- **Cell Data Management:** Tracking parameters like height, capacity, and voltage.
- **Configuration Calculations:** Automating series, parallel, and module configurations.
- **Energy and Voltage Calculations:** Ensuring pack design meets application needs.
