- **Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)**: An electric motor that uses permanent magnets in the rotor and operates synchronously with the stator's rotating magnetic field.
- **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)**: An advanced motor control technique that optimizes the performance of electric motors by independently controlling torque and magnetic flux.
- **Axial Flux Motor**: A type of electric motor where the magnetic flux runs parallel to the motor's axis, allowing for higher torque density and compact design.
- **Regenerative Braking**: A system in electric vehicles that recaptures kinetic energy during braking and converts it into electrical energy for storage in the battery.
- **Torque Density**: The amount of torque a motor can produce per unit of its size or weight.
- **Wide Bandgap Semiconductors**: Semiconductor materials like Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) that offer superior performance in power electronics, enabling higher efficiency and temperature tolerance.
- **State of Charge (SoC)**: A measure of the remaining energy in a battery relative to its total capacity.
- **State of Health (SoH)**: An assessment of a battery's condition and its ability to store and deliver energy compared to its original state.
- **Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus**: A robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other without a host computer.

- **Asynchronous Motor (ASM)**: An electric motor where the rotor does not rotate at the same speed as the stator's rotating magnetic field. Also known as an Induction Motor.
- **Slip**: The difference between the synchronous speed of the stator's magnetic field and the actual speed of the rotor, expressed as a percentage of synchronous speed.
- **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)**: An advanced motor control technique that independently controls torque and magnetic flux, enhancing motor performance and efficiency.
- **Direct Torque Control (DTC)**: A control method for electric motors that directly controls the motor torque and flux without the need for a separate modulation stage.
- **Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)**: An electronic controller that adjusts the frequency and voltage supplied to an electric motor, enabling variable speed and torque control.
- **Squirrel Cage Rotor**: A type of rotor design in ASMs consisting of conductive bars short-circuited by end rings, known for simplicity and durability.
- **Wound Rotor**: A rotor type in ASMs that features windings connected to external resistors or slip rings, allowing for variable speed control.
- **Regenerative Braking**: A system in electric vehicles that recaptures kinetic energy during braking and converts it into electrical energy for storage in the battery.
- **Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus**: A robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other without a host computer.
- **Power Electronics**: Electronic systems that convert and control electrical power, essential for managing energy flow between the battery, motor, and other vehicle systems.
