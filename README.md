## MATLAB/Simulink Resources

The `matlab-simulink` folder includes models, scripts, and tools to develop and simulate BMS components and algorithms.

### Features

- **Cell Parameter Estimation**: Tools for estimating critical battery cell parameters.
- **Controller Design**: Control algorithms for efficient BMS operation.
- **Fault Management**: Fault detection and mitigation models.
- **Battery Pack Design**: Simulation models to design and test battery packs.
- **Plant Models**: Comprehensive simulation models of the battery system.

### Key Files

- `bms.slx`: The main Simulink model for the BMS.
- `mini-bms.slx`: A simplified Simulink model for quick prototyping.
- `main.m`: A MATLAB script to execute simulations.
- `bms-lib.slx`: A library of reusable Simulink BMS components.

## Python Scripts

The `python` folder contains scripts for advanced analysis, simulations, and visualization of battery systems.

### Available Scripts

- **Battery Pack Sizing**: `battery_pack_sizing.py`  
  Perform calculations for battery pack design and sizing.
  
- **Connection Simulation**: `battery_connection_simulator.py`  
  Simulate different battery connection configurations (series/parallel).

- **State Estimation**: `kalman-filter.py`  
  Implement a Kalman Filter for estimating battery states.

- **Data Analysis**: `linear-regression.py`  
  Analyze battery data using linear regression techniques.

- **Visualization**: `spider-chart-li-ion.py`  
  Create spider charts to visualize key battery parameters.

## Documentation

This repository includes detailed documentation built with **Docusaurus**, providing insights into using and extending the available tools and models.

1. **Install Docusaurus CLI**  
   Install the Docusaurus CLI tool globally using npm or yarn:  
   Example with `npm`:
   ```bash
   npm install --global docusaurus-init
   ```

2. **Initialize the Documentation**  
   Navigate to your project directory and initialize a new Docusaurus site:
   ```bash
   npx docusaurus-init
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up your documentation structure.

3. **Build the Documentation**  
   Navigate to the documentation directory (e.g., `docs`) and build the documentation:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The generated files will be available in the `build` directory.

4. **Serve the Documentation Locally**  
   Preview the documentation locally by running:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Deploy the Documentation**  
   Deploy the built documentation to any static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) by uploading the contents of the `build` folder.
